	extensions).
	Either way, it should probably be removed unless it's really 
	needed.
	If it is needed it should be fixed.

	calls to our javascript buttons so that they work    with modern Tomcat

	W10n patch
	
	Fixed the hyraxTest tests so they no longer depend on a 
	specific server version number
	I adopted the same fix I use in the BES for date/time stamps: 
	use sed to look for
	a specific regex and replace it with something that won't vary. 
	In this case I
	look for 'OPeNDAP Hyrax (.*)' and replace it with 'OPeNDAP 
	Hyrax (Not.A.Release).'
	This means the exsiting baselines will work (I added the fix in 
	for building new
	baselines as well). I did not look for the OLFS version string.

	config has a new option to enable the use of a default   login end 
	point. If enabled when a unauthenticated client asks for    a protected 
	resource it is redirected to the default login    endpoint. In the case 
	of URS (or other SOS IdPs) this will result    in the client being sent 
	to the SOS provider for authentication.

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant 
	production rules are not run. The ant build  utilizes a filter step 
	that applies version numbers to vraious componets of the software. The 
	old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against 
	the core code prior to building with actual release numbers otherwise  
	the baselines never conform.

	Added template code for autotest tests
	
2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in 
	BESError processing in favor of the more reliable set of JSP pages to 
	which all other errors are directed. This greatly streamlines the error 
	processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern of 
	error handling at the top level of our various servlets.
	
2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single 
	entry and the entries contain useful information and no duplicate 
	information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types and errors.
	
2016-01-11  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.
	
	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType 
	object for error processing were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object 
	as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really didn't need that 
	information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up 
	the API too.
	
2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error 
	content is caught in the BES class so that BES client connection life 
	cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the work of 
	transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() 
	chain. By adding response media type awareness to the system we should 
	now be in a position to handle specific errors at a high level, and 
	return to the client an error that looks something like what they are 
	expecting.
	
2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized 
	configuration. Now it will look for the environment variable 
	OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs,

	URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl
	This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where 
	directories
	that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to 
	change how
	URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work 
	in a
	browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
	encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

2015-03-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Added a test for dependent vars with greater rank then the 
	independent vars.
	It's a mouthful... Anyway, the code actually limits the
	difference in rank to just one additional dimension.
	
2015-03-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Modified gitignore
	
	Build changes for the aggregation servlet
	Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons 
	io and
	so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml 
	file. The
	commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; 
	there are
	other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to 
	be a
	factor.
	
	Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java
	IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
	of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
	overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
	IDE. I removed the change for now.
	
	Added a number of test input and baseline files
	These are for the aggregation servlet.
	
2015-03-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Modified text files to use the new &operation= parameter
	...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
	information.
	
	Modified how operation is provided
	The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
	last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
	string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
	code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in 
	practice).
	I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
	did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
	breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
	get a redirect.
	
	Added the CSV feature to the servlet
	This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
	are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
	response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
	the same input parameters.
	
	I moved the unit-test sources and baselines to resources
	I'm not sure this is the best place, but I want to have my test
	code part of typical distributions.
	
2015-03-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Added FilterAsciiHeaderStream
	...and tests
	
	Minor refactor of method names
	
	Added two new response types: nc4 and ASCII
	
2015-03-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Aggregation servlet 1.0 beta
	Fixed some warning issues, documentation, unused code, ...
	Also, added the sole unit test file to build.xml and hacked
	in the README file a bit.
	
2015-03-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Fixed use of DEPLOYMENT_CONTEXT in production rules.
	
2015-03-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Added unit tests for AggregationParams
	These are mostly a token effort, but I wanted to go through the
	process since I suspect that when I'm working on the CSV stuff
	the tests will matter.
	
	The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.
	The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
	is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
	of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
	possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
	(for now at least).

2015-02-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Updated copyright date in the Aggregation servlet.
	
	Fixed the redirect issue
	URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
	Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
	Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.
	
	Added just tiny bit to the Servlets doc comment.
	
	Added POST support; fixed minor issues
	POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
	that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
	where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
	the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
	between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
	netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
	the source files.
	
	First working version; no support for POST yet
	This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
	of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
	the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
	source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.
	
2015-02-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Added more features
	The servlet can get small text files and return them
	in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
	but that's for tomorrow...
	
2015-02-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Updated inner class for compatibility with the servlet 
3.0 specification

	Hacking toward some sort of BES interaction...
	
2015-02-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>
	
	Hacks to AggregationServlet.java
	The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
	BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
	my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
	about loosing code, so in it goes.
	
	More merge maddness
	I did a pull for some changes Nathan added and used stash
	to hold onto the work I was doing on my agg branch, but
	somehow botched the stash apply or something. I think I
	inadvertantly have merged my branch to the master...
	
	pull/merge/deleted files... Friday afternoon...

	Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet
	This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
	There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
	code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
	get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

	Initial commit - started at home; not working
	
2015-02-18  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs:  Implemented w10n "traverse" query string parameter, but 
	limited the scope of it's applicability to datasets and their 
	variables. The "traverse" parameter is ignored at the filesystem level. 
	Because, well, think about it...
	
	olfs:  Made JSON output indented
	
	Replaced json-simple library with Gson because the json-simple 
	library was blowing it when encoding complex string attribute values
	
2015-02-17  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Minor API cleanup. Comments!
	
	olfs: Refactored use of w10nRequest object to simplify the 
	internal API and to coalesce methods into the w10nRequest class so that 
	the code can be more easily understood. Re worker the use of "path" and 
	"identifier" to correctly represent section 3 of the w10n specification.
	
2015-02-13  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Added w10n meta object to w10n json data responses.
	
	olfs: Implement netcdf-3, netcdf-4, and dap2 data responses. 
	Groomed MediaType stack
	
2015-02-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	DAP catalog navigation.

2015-01-15  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Failed to patch the NcWMS service, fixed now.
	
	olfs: Patched the generation of Godiva links to accommodate the 
	new (old?) TDS like arrangement where the Dynamic Service dataset name 
	appears in the URL path and not in the query string as the value of the 
	"dataset" parameter. (Because the former is WMS compliant and the 
	latter is not)
	
	olfs: Moved around some utility methods so that similar tools 
	are kept together.
	
2015-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>
	
	olfs: Updating version numbers, NEWS, ChangeLog, and README for 
	HYrax 1.10.1 / OLFS 1.12.1
	
	olfs: Dropped broken test for dataset WMSness. Will have to 
	revisit in the futuregitlog-to-changelog: warning: empty commit message:

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the 
	stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures 
	that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the 
	commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started 
	when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That 
	leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but 
	no one but us will every relaize that).

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used 
	break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 
127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). 
	The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first 
	match of a URL and a group. I also added a size() method to URLGroups.
	
	Added the old NCMLWriter and testStackSave classes

	olfs-wcs:  Fine tuned exception handling to satisfy fortify...
	
	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop 
	method
	
	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors 
	are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions 
	(by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown 
	and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that 
	processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for 
	production code that is running as a service and that needs to be 
	stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual 
	exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws 
	clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in 
	conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a 
	supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic 
	processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet 
	to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing 
	InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a 
	ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if 
	processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of 
	critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to 
	change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to 
	accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been 
	read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the 
	construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would 
	never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update 
	correctly.

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its 
	own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in 
	postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to 
	ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root 
	URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in 
	the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once 
	to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access 
	always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely 
	disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.
	
	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler 
	does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. 
	But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog 
	using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	Metacat no longer used for caching...
	
	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a 
	cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a 
	start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the 
	processing it does.
	
	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access 
	to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but 
	it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation 
	for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache 
	next... However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will 
	save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's 
	easy to find.

        Controls the state of the in-memory cache for BES catalog/node
        responses. refreshInterval in seconds. The maxEntries attribute
        defines the maximum number of entries in the cache. If the serviced
        collection is large then making this larger will definitely improve
        response times for catalogs etc. The refreshInterval attribute controls
        how long any particular item remains in the cache. If the underlying
        system has a lot of change (model result output etc) then making this
        number smaller will increase the rate at which the change becomes
        "available" through the Hyrax service, at the expense of more cache
        churn and slower responses. If the underlying system is fairly stable
        (undergoes little change) then refreshInterval can be larger which will
        mean less cache churn and faster responses.

        variables before they may utilize the 'Get As X' buttons in the UI. This
        effectively prevents users from inadvertently asking that the entire
        dataset be converted into NetCDF (for example) when all they actually
        require are one or two variables. If not enabled the Data Request Forms
        will not require the user to make a selection.

        client behavior.

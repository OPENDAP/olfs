# OLFS Version 1.18.3 (25 February 2019)

## Features:

- Added a context/request sensitive message to all support email links.

- Added support email links to directory/collection pages in addition to error
  pages.
  
- Decoupled support email configuration from site/server administrator 
  information.

- Added sitemap generation and an (optional) ROOT.war service that adds a 
  robots.txt service for said sitemap.

- Enable THREDDS catalog brokering for remote catalogs.

## Bug Fixes

- Corrected the CovJson response Content-Type headers

- Repaired incompatibility between IFH Request forms and CentOS-6

- Fixed odd port problem with redirect code.

- Repaired Viewers pages to correctly process encoded URL content.


# OLFS Version 1.18.2 (10 December 2018)

## Features:

- Added new (beta) dynamic siteMap and robots.txt service.

- Added confguration (to BES) for Site admin contact information that
  also gets used in the JSON-LD DataCatalog content. 

# OLFS Version 1.18.1 (21 November 2018)

- Minor changes mostly a release to support changes in the BES.

# OLFS Version 1.18.0 (26 September 2018)

## Features:

- NEW! Improved! The OPeNDAP Data Request Form!

- CovJson responses for compatible datasets.

- Simplified the OLFS configuration file, olfs.xml (If you are upgrading 
  you will need to replace your existing file with the new default one and 
  edit to recover your changes.)

- JSON-LD now in every contents.html page and in every Data Request Form.

- Hyrax now supports the browsing of remote THREDDS catalogs. This feature
  is disabled by default, and when enabled will only be allowed to access 
  remote systems based on the Gateway.Whitelist in the BES.

- Added optional login controls and framework for adding URS (or other) 
  authentication and identification providers.

- Switched to the OWASP string encoder/decoder.

- Added an additional default configuration location '/use/share/olfs'

## Bug Fixes:

- Added URI encoding to requests generated by the Data Access Forms so that
  special characters such as '[' and ']' are now encoded correctly.

- Applied a work-around patch to the THREDDS catalogs generated by Hyrax  
  to accomodate a java-netcdf problem in which no timezone abbreviations
  other than Z (or none at all) are allowed. The patch maps known GMT
  equivalents to Z and all other timzones are simpley dropped (which is
  also an allowed representation by java-netcdf)

- Repaired Gateway Service UI so that both DAP2 and DAP4 response are 
  represented and functioning.

- Updated URS client implementation to work with current code base.

# OLFS Version 1.17.0  (16 October 2017)

- Added WCS service.
  - Works using templates associated by regex.

- Made the OLFS authentication aware in its http
  activities by having it utilize the ~/.netrc credentials 
  source or one of the same format specified in the configuration. 

- Fixed bug in the generation of the "viewers" pages.

# OLFS Version 1.16.4  (09 August 2017)

- Repaired broken RDF responses.

- Updated dependecy Jars.

- Enabled ThreddsCatalogUtil to authenticate against Earthdata Login

- Merged eo-wcs features into master

# OLFS Version 1.16.3 (05 Jun 2017)

- Server timeout conditions now return HTTP status 504Â (and not 418).

- Bug fixes in the DAP4 Data Request Form pages.

# OLFS Version 1.16.2 (10 Jan 2017)

- Improved logging, including log rotation.

- Fixed a null pointer exception in the AggregationServlet (the
  component that performs user-specified aggregations).

- Repaired viewers.xml configuration for Godiva3

- Issues with the netcdf file response History attribute were fixed,
  once again...

- Prompted by user requests we have changed the HTTP status returned when 
  the server encounters a BES timeout error from 418 (I'm a teapot) to 504 
  (Gateway Timeout) We really liked the teapot because we felt applying the 
  504 (Gateway Timeout) status to this error strains the formal definition 
  of the 504 status code and could lead to confusion down the road. 
  Time will tell...


# OLFS Version 1.16.1  (02 Nov 2016)

- Updated OLFS configuration defaults in viewers.xml file to reflect
  changes for ncWMS2 and Godiva3
    
- Patched a problem with the way the XSL transforms are carried out
  that could have left the process running in an unexpected directory.
      

# OLFS Version 1.16.0  (06 June 2016)

 - Added code to ammend the CF "history" attribute so that
    fileout_netcdf responses contain the ammended value that shows
    that Hyrax produced it along withg the constraint and id
    information of the dataset.

 - Added new rules for the Content-Disposition header download file
    names. Now the old behavior (add the netcdf file suffix to very
    file's basename) can be replaced so that if the suffix will end up
    as a duplicate (for example file.nc.nc or file.nc4.nc4), nothing
    is appended.

 - Added memory cache for BES Catalog responses. This allows the OLFS
    to stop asking the same things over and over again. The size and
    refresh interval are specified by the "<CatalogCache> element in
    the olfs.xml file. If the element is missing then the memory cache
    will be disabled.

 - Increased the number of simultaneous requests from 10 to 200 ,
    which is the default limit for Tomcat.

 -  Bug fixes
    - Large file issues in w10n.
    - Fixed build for WCS-2.0


# OLFS Version 1.15.0  (08 February 2016)

 -  The OLFS regression test harness has been migrated from DejaGnu to AutoTest. This makes writing and maintaining
    tests much easier. All of the DejaGnu tests have been migrated and many additional tests added. To configure the
    tests:
        autoconf -vif
        ./configure
    To run the tests:
        make check

 -  Error handling has been refactored. Error messages from libdap and the BES are now correctly transmitted to the
    user. Additionally the HTTP status codes and associated pages are now working correctly and there should be a
    significant reduction in the number of "superman" (Internal Error) pages encountered in normal operation.

 -  The default size of the BES client pool has been increased from 10 to 200 in response to numerous performance
    evaluators that failed to recognize that this could be done to increase performance in high traffic environments.

 -  The OLFS now keeps the BES on a timeout leash so that BES requests that take longer than the time out interval
    stated in the olfs.xml will actually timeout and return an associated error to the OLFS.

 -  !!!!! The location of the OLFS configuration directory has changed !!!!
    This change should resolve installation problems with Tomcat instances that are installed from RPM.
    By default the OLFS will utilize it's bundled configuration in the directory
      $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/conf
    In order to localize the configuration so that your configuration changes are persistent you will need to do
    one of the following:
      * For the user that will be running the OLFS (the Tomcat user), set the environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR to
        an existing directory to which the Tomcat user has both read and write privileges.
      OR
      * Create the directory /etc/olfs and set it's permissions/ownership so that the Tomcat user has both read and
        write permission.
    (If both of these steps are done then priority is given to the environment variable.)
    Restart Tomcat. When it starts the OLFS will check these locations and then install a copy of its default
    configuration into the new spot.
    Edit the configuration files as needed.
    If, for example, your beslistener is not running on localhost:10022 then you'll need to edit the olfs.xml
    file in the configuration directory and adjust the <host> and <port>  values to reflect your situation.

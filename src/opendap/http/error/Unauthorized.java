/**
 * The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a
 * WWW-Authenticate header field (section 14.47) containing a challenge
 * applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY repeat the request
 * with a suitable Authorization header field (section 14.8). If the
 * request already included Authorization credentials, then the 401
 * response indicates that authorization has been refused for those
 * credentials. If the 401 response contains the same challenge as the
 * prior response, and the user agent has already attempted authentication
 * at least once, then the user SHOULD be presented the entity that was
 * given in the response, since that entity might include relevant diagnostic
 * information. HTTP access authentication is explained in
 * "HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication" [43].

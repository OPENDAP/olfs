	Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/test-macro-fixes' into hyrax-1.15

	Macro fixes - first round. The REMOVE_DATE_TIME macro is noise, maybe
	I think REMOVE_DATE_TIME was copied over from the BES generic macro
	file and was never used. It then was modified, but those modifications
	used Java/Perl regex features (or maybe special GNU sed extensions).
	Either way, it should probably be removed unless it's really needed.
	If it is needed it should be fixed.

2018-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor edits to the OLFS test macros. I 'fixed' a date/time regex.

In the case of URS (or other SOS IdPs) this will result    in the client being sent to the SOS provider for authentication.

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    information.

commit ec7d1e3a47c7f73c7f9930bec08e378d5a6a29e6
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    code part of typical distributions.

    Aggregation servlet 1.0 beta

    Also, added the sole unit test file to build.xml and hacked
    in the README file a bit.

    Added unit tests for AggregationParams

    These are mostly a token effort, but I wanted to go through the
    process since I suspect that when I'm working on the CSV stuff
    the tests will matter.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 3 15:51:20 2015 -0700

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:07:04 2015 -0700

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:36:37 2015 -0700

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

Date:   Mon Feb 23 18:08:06 2015 -0700

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the

    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

2010-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interim check in - the code need to be refactored to make it easier to use. There's a fairly confusing array of caching options. Reduce to just postgres and hash maps and do that using two distict classes.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added resources for the crawler that uses the Postgres DB for a persistent store.

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	Added tests for this case, too.

	Changed the Dap4Responder.addTypeSuffixToDownloadFilename() behavior
	Now the code will use the original behavior when this is false (always

	Made BesResponseCache more durable by: - Fixed purging problems.

	Made BesResponseCache more durable by: - Fixed purging problems.

	Made BesResponseCache more durable by:  - Added caching of BESError objects. This reduces the probing/thrashing  of the  BES by the OLFS.  - Set a cache size (in terms of number of items) limit  - Added  a "purgeLeastRecentlyAccessed()" method to control cache size.

2016-04-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added new appender definition for the log harvester to the logback configuration.

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

2016-01-26  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Pretty format changes

	olfs: Turned down the log  for the document handling version of  besTransaction() from error

	olfs: Fixed the dap4 ifh for sequence so that it displays and allows the selection of 
	child variables.

	Added more error tests, updated server to return a simple DAP2Error when there's a problem 
	with a csv request.

	Added template code for autotest tests

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types 
	and errors.

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

2015-12-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	I think that this collection of changes connects the admin email address in the BES 
	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	first.

	Debugging instrumentation to better understand the hang-up issues.

2015-12-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how

    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:07:04 2015 -0700

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:36:37 2015 -0700

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

Date:   Mon Feb 23 18:08:06 2015 -0700

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
    code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

    olfs: Refactored use of w10nRequest object to simplify the internal API and to coalesce methods into the w10nRequest class so that the code can be more easily understood. Re worker the use of "path" and "identifier" to correctly represent section 3 of the w10n specification.

Author: Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 15 10:38:43 2015 -0800

    olfs: Patched the generation of Godiva links to accommodate the new (old?) TDS like arrangement where the Dynamic Service dataset name appears in the URL path and not in the query string as the value of the "dataset" parameter. (Because the former is WMS compliant and the latter is not)

Date:   Mon Jan 5 08:24:08 2015 -0800

    olfs: Dropped broken test for dataset WMSness. Will have to revisit in the future, as users will likely dislike false positives (showing WMS and Godiva links for incompatible datasets) almost as much as false negatives (not showing WMS and Godiva links for valid WMS datasets)

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

2010-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interim check in - the code need to be refactored to make it easier to use. There's a fairly confusing array of caching options. Reduce to just postgres and hash maps and do that using two distict classes.

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	Fixed an issue when the filename is < 4 characters
	Added tests for this case, too.

	Changed the Dap4Responder.addTypeSuffixToDownloadFilename() behavior
	Now the code will use the original behavior when this is false (always
	add the suffix), or _replace_ the existing suffix if it's true. I added

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

2016-01-26  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Pretty format changes

	olfs: Turned down the log  for the document handling version of  besTransaction() from error

	Added more error tests, updated server to return a simple DAP2Error when there's a problem 
	with a csv request.

	Added template code for autotest tests

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types 
	and errors.

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

	Merge branch 'master' into BES-38

2015-12-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	I think that this collection of changes connects the admin email address in the BES 
	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	first.

	Debugging instrumentation to better understand the hang-up issues.

2015-12-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    Modified text files to use the new &operation= parameter

    ...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
    information.

commit ec7d1e3a47c7f73c7f9930bec08e378d5a6a29e6
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

commit 1fd374b914137bca8911dd93c85e06146c34ba41
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:10:41 2015 -0700

    Updated copyright date in the Aggregation servlet.

commit 3e963abc25b102e96a5b72fccd07a11c3ddbe24a
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:07:04 2015 -0700

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

commit e088ba580665acd3554385f6fa1a504e41707b1a
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:43:52 2015 -0700

    Added just tiny bit to the Servlets doc comment.

commit f81fe5715d57999722276742e75ca07491bc595b
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:36:37 2015 -0700

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

commit 19d0260f89b2a4bc15354681d04781585aadae10
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 12:32:37 2015 -0700

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

commit 0cb42d49514d5d85c4530238618a94876637cafd
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 23 18:08:06 2015 -0700

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacking toward some sort of BES interaction...

commit 6f5ac667b8dd64077c4f6d60b5070cccaed853f9
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 20 18:05:41 2015 -0700

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

commit 89fc19b33cf02b54393ae64991fed10d2722d9ef
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 20 17:58:03 2015 -0700

    More merge maddness

    I did a pull for some changes Nathan added and used stash
    to hold onto the work I was doing on my agg branch, but
    somehow botched the stash apply or something. I think I
    inadvertantly have merged my branch to the master...

Date:   Fri Feb 20 15:53:35 2015 -0700

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
    code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

    olfs: Refactored use of w10nRequest object to simplify the internal API and to coalesce methods into the w10nRequest class so that the code can be more easily understood. Re worker the use of "path" and "identifier" to correctly represent section 3 of the w10n specification.

    olfs: Patched the generation of Godiva links to accommodate the new (old?) TDS like arrangement where the Dynamic Service dataset name appears in the URL path and not in the query string as the value of the "dataset" parameter. (Because the former is WMS compliant and the latter is not)

    olfs: Dropped broken test for dataset WMSness. Will have to revisit in the future, as users will likely dislike false positives (showing WMS and Godiva links for incompatible datasets) almost as much as false negatives (not showing WMS and Godiva links for valid WMS datasets)

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

2010-05-18  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

2010-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interim check in - the code need to be refactored to make it easier to use. There's a fairly confusing array of caching options. Reduce to just postgres and hash maps and do that using two distict classes.

	Added comments about first successful crawl over the entire ghrsst part of the NODC site.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added resources for the crawler that uses the Postgres DB for a persistent store.

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

	olfs: Repaired race condition in error processing. woot...

	olfs: Repaired race condition in error processing. woot...

	Pruned old bes tests.

	yet support this function only DAP2 tests were added.

2016-01-18  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added more error tests, updated server to return a simple DAP2Error when there's a problem 
	with a csv request.

	Changed error test names to match convention already in use. Renamed test macros file to 
	reflect it's actual content.

	Added template code for autotest tests

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	first.

	Debugging instrumentation to better understand the hang-up issues.

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    olfs: Repaired a bug in THREDDS catalog ingest where the value of the serviceType attribute  of thredds:service elements was being assessed in a case sensitive manner.  Made it a case-insensitive test.

    It's a mouthful... Anyway, the code actually limits the
    difference in rank to just one additional dimension.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the

    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    olfs: Refactored use of w10nRequest object to simplify the internal API and to coalesce methods into the w10nRequest class so that the code can be more easily understood. Re worker the use of "path" and "identifier" to correctly represent section 3 of the w10n specification.

Author: Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 15 10:38:43 2015 -0800

    olfs: Patched the generation of Godiva links to accommodate the new (old?) TDS like arrangement where the Dynamic Service dataset name appears in the URL path and not in the query string as the value of the "dataset" parameter. (Because the former is WMS compliant and the latter is not)

Date:   Mon Jan 5 08:24:08 2015 -0800

    olfs: Dropped broken test for dataset WMSness. Will have to revisit in the future, as users will likely dislike false positives (showing WMS and Godiva links for incompatible datasets) almost as much as false negatives (not showing WMS and Godiva links for valid WMS datasets)

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

	olfs: Code cleaning...

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	Added tests for this case, too.

	Changed the Dap4Responder.addTypeSuffixToDownloadFilename() behavior
	Now the code will use the original behavior when this is false (always
	add the suffix), or _replace_ the existing suffix if it's true. I added

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

	Added template code for autotest tests

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types 
	and errors.

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

	Merge branch 'master' into BES-38

2015-12-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	I think that this collection of changes connects the admin email address in the BES 
	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	first.

	Debugging instrumentation to better understand the hang-up issues.

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Added a test for dependent vars with greater rank then the independent vars.

    It's a mouthful... Anyway, the code actually limits the
    difference in rank to just one additional dimension.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    Modified text files to use the new &operation= parameter

    ...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
    information.

commit ec7d1e3a47c7f73c7f9930bec08e378d5a6a29e6
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    Added unit tests for AggregationParams

    These are mostly a token effort, but I wanted to go through the

    the tests will matter.

commit f18e82d325ec5ba6137c6840535ccacda3f77204

Date:   Tue Mar 3 15:51:20 2015 -0700

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

commit 1fd374b914137bca8911dd93c85e06146c34ba41
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:10:41 2015 -0700

    Updated copyright date in the Aggregation servlet.

commit 3e963abc25b102e96a5b72fccd07a11c3ddbe24a
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:07:04 2015 -0700

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

commit e088ba580665acd3554385f6fa1a504e41707b1a

    Added just tiny bit to the Servlets doc comment.

commit f81fe5715d57999722276742e75ca07491bc595b
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:36:37 2015 -0700

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

commit 19d0260f89b2a4bc15354681d04781585aadae10
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 12:32:37 2015 -0700

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

commit 0cb42d49514d5d85c4530238618a94876637cafd
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 23 18:08:06 2015 -0700

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    More merge maddness

    I did a pull for some changes Nathan added and used stash
    to hold onto the work I was doing on my agg branch, but
    somehow botched the stash apply or something. I think I
    inadvertantly have merged my branch to the master...

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
    code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	Added tests for this case, too.

	Changed the Dap4Responder.addTypeSuffixToDownloadFilename() behavior

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

2016-01-26  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Added more error tests, updated server to return a simple DAP2Error when there's a problem 
	with a csv request.

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain

	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    ...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
    information.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    code part of typical distributions.

    Added unit tests for AggregationParams

    These are mostly a token effort, but I wanted to go through the
    process since I suspect that when I'm working on the CSV stuff
    the tests will matter.

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	Metacat code now builds a histogram for each group and has more data stored internally. I added results from a set of crawls, plus the raw DDX URL cache files, to the resources/metacat directory. This hold information for about 3.5 millon URLs and 270+ groups.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

2015-12-23  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	I think that this collection of changes connects the admin email address in the BES 
	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	first.

2015-12-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Added missing semaphore file for the default config install during bootstrap.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    ...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
    information.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    More merge maddness

    I did a pull for some changes Nathan added and used stash
    to hold onto the work I was doing on my agg branch, but
    somehow botched the stash apply or something. I think I
    inadvertantly have merged my branch to the master...

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
    code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Several minor fixes plus a big one - new patterns added for grouping that drop the count of groups on the NDOC archive from 8,000+ to 56.

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

	Added tests for this case, too.

	Changed the Dap4Responder.addTypeSuffixToDownloadFilename() behavior
	Now the code will use the original behavior when this is false (always

2016-01-27  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Patched tests. When build from my IDE the "normal" ant production rules are not run. 
	The ant build  utilizes a filter step that applies version numbers to vraious componets of 
	the software. The old  baselines have the unfiltered values. The new baselines have the 
	default version values of "Not.A.Release"  Tests should be run against the core code prior 
	to building with actual release numbers otherwise  the baselines never conform.

	Added template code for autotest tests

2016-01-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: More error handling changes. Dumped the use of XSLT in BESError processing in favor 
	of the more reliable set of JSP pages to which all other errors are directed. This greatly 
	streamlines the error processing, reduces complexity, and allows for a consistent pattern 
	of error handling at the top level of our various servlets.

2016-01-12  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Reworked access log so that each request has a single entry and the entries contain 
	useful information and no duplicate information. Fixed problems in w10n with media types 
	and errors.

2016-01-08  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Working on problems in w0n with media types and errors.

	olfs: I had to step back and change the way that the MediaType object for error processing 
	were handled. Removed the MEdiaType object as a parameter to the BesApi a (whcih really 
	didn't need that information) and simply toss it in the Request cache once we knpow what 
	the target media type should be. This works much better and cleans up the API too.

2016-01-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Refactored error handling so that actualll BES error content is caught in the BES class 
	so that BES client connection life cycles can be better managed. This change also shifted the 
	work of transmitting the errors to the OPeNDAPException.anyExceptionHandler() chain. By adding 
	response media type awareness to the system we should now be in a position to handle specific 
	errors at a high level, and return to the client an error that looks something like what they 
	are expecting.

2016-01-04  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs: Changed name of error XSL files for BESErrors to better reflect their purpose.

	I think that this collection of changes connects the admin email address in the BES 
	configuration(s) with the email addresses that appear in the error pages of the server.

	Added a set_context call for bes_timeout based on the value in the olfs.xml file

	olfs: Started adding API methods for acquiring admin email from BES.

	olfs: More changes in support of configuration location.

	olfs: Reworked the way that the OLFS finds a localized configuration. Now it will look for the 
	environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR and use it. Lacking that it will check for /etc/olfs, and 
	lacking that it will utilize the default configuration deployed with the OLFS application. This 
	ensures that the OLFS can start without a new user having to do much."

    URI-encoded the href output by contents.xsl

    This was part of the fix for the NASA/Raytheon issue where directories
    that contain colons were not working. Part of the fix was to change how
    URL/URIs are scrubbed. However, to get the HTML pages to work in a
    browser, the href elements built by centents.xsl had to use
    encode-for-uri(@name) and not just @name.

    Build changes for the aggregation servlet

    Fir my aggregation servlet JUnit tests, I used apache commons io and
    so I added that jar to the lib dir and then to the build.xml file. The
    commons io jar is only installed for the opendap.war file; there are
    other targets in the build.xml file where it does not seem to be a
    factor.

    Update/fix for FilterAsciiHeaderStream.java

    IJ Idea suggested I add @NotNull to the byte[] parameter
    of the write() methods my FilterStream specialization
    overrode, but that broke the ant build. It worked in the
    IDE. I removed the change for now.

    Modified text files to use the new &operation= parameter

    ...and added a text file that requests the servlet version
    information.

commit ec7d1e3a47c7f73c7f9930bec08e378d5a6a29e6
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 6 16:03:17 2015 -0700

    Modified how operation is provided

    The operation to perform was derived from the URL, using the
    last part of the path. I dropped that in favor of using a query
    string parameter so that this servlet will work with our json
    code (at least in theory; I'm not sure how it'll work in practice).
    I also fixed an issue where POST would redirect when the URL
    did not end in a slash - this is good behavior for GET, but it
    breaks POST because clients like curl don't expect POST to
    get a redirect.

    Added the CSV feature to the servlet

    This includes some changes to the way the input parameters
    are parsed, depending on how the servlet is called. The CSV
    response along with the netcdf3/4 and ascii responses use
    the same input parameters.

    Aggregation servlet 1.0 beta

    Fixed some warning issues, documentation, unused code, ...
    Also, added the sole unit test file to build.xml and hacked
    in the README file a bit.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 3 17:46:03 2015 -0700

    Added unit tests for AggregationParams

    These are mostly a token effort, but I wanted to go through the
    process since I suspect that when I'm working on the CSV stuff
    the tests will matter.

commit f18e82d325ec5ba6137c6840535ccacda3f77204
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 3 15:51:20 2015 -0700

    The aggregation server now uses the swath subsetting function.

    The bbox query string parameter is now parsed and its value
    is used to build the subsetting expression along with the list
    of variable names. However, bbox is not required and it's
    possible to use the var parameter to pass in a complete CE
    (for now at least).

commit 1fd374b914137bca8911dd93c85e06146c34ba41
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:10:41 2015 -0700

    Updated copyright date in the Aggregation servlet.

commit 3e963abc25b102e96a5b72fccd07a11c3ddbe24a
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 18:07:04 2015 -0700

    Fixed the redirect issue

    URLs to the base servlet need trailing slashes. I copied
    Nathan's redirect code so this will work. I also used the
    Idea code analysis to fix up some minor issues.

commit e088ba580665acd3554385f6fa1a504e41707b1a

    Added just tiny bit to the Servlets doc comment.

commit f81fe5715d57999722276742e75ca07491bc595b
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 14:36:37 2015 -0700

    Added POST support; fixed minor issues

    POST and GET now both work. I added an extensive comment
    that includes an example call using curl. I fixed an issue
    where the Set<String> used to find name collisions in
    the files to be added to the zip archive was not reset
    between calls. Also, the servlet now adds ".nc" when
    netCDF3 files are requested, no matter what the type of
    the source files.

commit 19d0260f89b2a4bc15354681d04781585aadae10
Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 24 12:32:37 2015 -0700

    First working version; no support for POST yet

    This version of the Aggregation servlet will return a zip file
    of arbitrary files or netcdf3 files built from any type of file
    the BES recognizes. In the latter case, a CE is applied to the
    source file before the result is returned as a netCDF3 file.

Author: James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 23 18:08:06 2015 -0700

    Added more features

    The servlet can get small text files and return them
    in a single zip file. It seems to gag on netcdf files,
    but that's for tomorrow...

    Hacks to AggregationServlet.java

    The AggregationServlet has been hacked so that it talks to the
    BES and gets a version response. I think. Not working yet, but
    my 'just do a pull' hijinks on Friday afternoon left me nervous
    about loosing code, so in it goes.

    More merge maddness

    I did a pull for some changes Nathan added and used stash
    to hold onto the work I was doing on my agg branch, but
    somehow botched the stash apply or something. I think I
    inadvertantly have merged my branch to the master...

    Switched from a child of opendap.DispatchServlet to HttpServlet

    This should simplify things and is more likely what I need.
    There is likely considerable simplification I can do to the
    code in this directory (opendap/aggregation), but I want to
    get some basic I/O working before I hack away at stuff.

	I changed the way that stopNice_worker is called so thet the stop nice command is sent to the besdaemon synchronously. This ensures that the stop command always precedes the start command. Running the commands in the reverse order means that the beslistener is started when it's already running (which has no effect) and then stopped. That leaves the server in a stopped state. You can restart it by hand (but no one but us will every relaize that).

2010-12-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In URLClassifier I used continue when I could/should have used break. Switching to break runs the code much faster (3:50 to process 127,000 urls with continue; 0:29 for the same 127,000 urls with break). The difference is that with break the searching stops at the first match of a URL and a group.
	I also added a size() method to URLGroups.

	olfs-wcs:  Removed catch for InterruptedException from drop method

2010-11-03  Nathan Potter <ndp@opendap.org>

	olfs-wcs: This is a major re-working of the way in which errors are handled in the WCS. Prior to this we were absorbing all exceptions (by catching java.lang.Exception) close to where they were being thrown and simply logging the errors. This was an effective way to ensure that processing code always run to completeion but not very useful for production code that is running as a service and that needs to be stopped. I reworked the exception handling to catch individual exception types and added java.lang.InterruptedException to the throws clause on almost every method in the semantic processing. This, in conjunction with the finally blocks already in place, allows a supervisory thread to call Thread.interrupt() on the semantic processing thread and cause it to quit. Mostly. There are still (as yet to identified) places in the code that seem to be swallowing InterruptedException. In order to ameliorate this I added a ProcessManager class that carries flags that can be checked to see if processing should be stopped. I added calls to this in a number of critical places in the semantic processing. Additionally, I had to change the logic of RepositoryOps.updateSemanticRepository() to accomodate the situation where all of the required documents have been read in, but processing was stopped before or during the running of the construct rules. Without the logic change the construct rules would never have been run again, and thus the catalog would never be update correctly.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the way postgres caches are used. Now each site gets its own cache by default (i.e., it's own table in the crawl_cache db in postgres). Here 'site' is really the 'cacheName' parameter passed to ddx_crawler.sh but that defaults to the host name of teh catalog root URL. Reading from the cache has been fixed too. Also, I fixed a bug in the TCU class where catalogs were accessed twice (over the net); once to get the refs and once to get the data urls. Now the second access always uses the cache unless some combination of options has completely disabled it. A better solution would be to rewrite the TCU code.

2010-10-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ThreddsCatalogUtil and DDXCrawler are fixed so that the crawler does not require that the cache files be deleted on subsequent runs. But the TCU code still is making several references to the same catalog using SAXBuilder which uses lots of time.

2010-05-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added this because it has useful stuff for the ThreddsCatalogUtil class in terms of caching in the absence of postgres. The current code uses postgres to cache values.

2010-05-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2010-05-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interim check in - the code need to be refactored to make it easier to use. There's a fairly confusing array of caching options. Reduce to just postgres and hash maps and do that using two distict classes.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This version of ResponseCache can use Postgres (and has partial support for JCS, although it makes a weak persistent store since you cannot be certain items won't be removed from the disk cache). Other classes have been updated to use the Postgres-enabled cache.

2010-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added resources for the crawler that uses the Postgres DB for a persistent store.

	Metacat no longer used for caching...

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added as a precaution... This version of TCU uses metacat as a cache - not complete, but see ResponseCacheMetacat.java for a look at a start. Metacat does not make a particularly good cache because of the processing it does.

2010-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This snapshot of the crawler has changes that implement access to metacat - I tried using metacat as a cache for thredds catalogs, but it was fairly slow (as a cache) and required a schema and validation for any xml in a namespace). I'm going to try the JCS disk cache next...
	However, this code shows how to call metacat from Java. I will save off this version of ResponseCache to ResponseCacheMetacat so it's easy to find.

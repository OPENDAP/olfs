The file install.html or docs/index.html may have additional information...

First:

    Build and install bes and at minimum the netcdf_handler projects.
    Launch the bes (you can use besctl to do that). 
    Make sure there s a beslistener process running.

Check it out:

    git clone https://github.com/OPENDAP/olfs.git


Build it:

    ant server

(To make a distribution for release:  ant server -DHYRAX_VERSION=<num> -DOLFS_VERSION=<num> )

Install it:

    rm -rf $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap*
    cp build/dist/opendap.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps

Launch it:

    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

Configure it:

    By default the OLFS will utilize it's bundled default configuration in the directory
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/conf

    In order to configure your system so that your configuration changes are persistent 
    you will need to do one of the following:

    * For the user that will be running the OLFS (the Tomcat user), set the 
      environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR to an existing directory to which 
      the  Tomcat user has both read and write privileges.

    OR

    * Create the directory /etc/olfs and set it's permissions/ownership so that 
      the Tomcat user has both read and write permission.

    If both of these steps are done then priority is given to the environment variable.

    Restart Tomcat. When it starts the OLFS will check these locations and then install a copy of its default
    configuration into the new spot.

    Edit the configuration files as needed.

    If, for example, your beslistener is not running on localhost:10022 then you'll need to edit the olfs.xml
    file in the configuration directory and adjust the <host> and <port>  values to reflect your situation.

Relaunch it:

    $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh; $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

    For the configuration changes to take effect.

See http://docs.opendap.org/index.php/Hyrax for information about this software, Installation
instructions and NEWS.

## About the Aggregation servlet

In src/opendap/aggregation we have a servlet that performs aggregation for use,
initially, with NASA's EDSC (Earth Data Search Client). In that directory you
will find a README along with some help in testing the servlet using curl.

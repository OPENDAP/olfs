        Controls the state of the in-memory cache for BES catalog/node

        defines the maximum number of entries in the cache. If the serviced
        collection is large then making this larger will definitely improve
        response times for catalogs etc. The refreshInterval attribute controls
        how long any particular item remains in the cache. If the underlying
        system has a lot of change (model result output etc) then making this
        number smaller will increase the rate at which the change becomes
        "available" through the Hyrax service, at the expense of more cache
        churn and slower responses. If the underlying system is fairly stable
        (undergoes little change) then refreshInterval can be larger which will
        mean less cache churn and faster responses.

    <!--
    <DatasetUrlResponse type="..." />
    Supported type values are: dsr, download, and requestForm
    The DatasetUrlResponse element is used to configure the type of response
    that the server will generate when a client attempts to access the Dataset URL.
    The type of response is controlled by the value of the type attribute.
    The supported values are: dsr, download, and requestForm.

    Allowed Values
    dsr:
        The dap4 DSR response will be returned for the dataset URL. Note: This
        setting is not compatible with DataRequestForm type of "dap2" as the
        DSR response URL collides with the DAP2 Data Request Form URL.

    download:
        If the configuration parameter AllowDirectDataSourceAccess is set (present) then
        the source data file will be returned for the dataset URL. If the configuration
        parameter AllowDirectDataSourceAccess is not present then a 403 forbidden will
        be returned for the dataset URL. (This is basically a file retrieval service,
        any constraint expression submitted with the dataset URL will be ignored.)

    requestForm:
        The Hyrax Data Request Form Page will be returned for the
        dataset URL.

    -->
    <DatasetUrlResponse type="download"/>

    <!--
        <DataRequestForm type="..." />
        Supported type values are: dap2 and dap4
        The DataRequestForm element defines the target DAP data model for the dataset links
        in the "blue-bar" catalog.html pages. These links point to the DAP Data Request Form for each dataset.
        This element also determines the type  of Data request form page  returned when the
        DatasetUrlResponse type="requestForm" and the request is for the Dataset URL.

    <DataRequestForm type="dap4" />

    <!--
        'AllowDirectDataSourceAccess' - When enabled users will be able to use

    <!--
    'ForceLinksToHttps' - The presence of this element will cause the server to "force" all
    of the links returned by the server to be expressed with the HTTPS protocol.

    When the 'ForceLinksToHttps' element is absent from the config (commented out) then
    the forcing to https is feature is disabled.

    The server will continue to return https urls when:
        - The incoming request URL uses https.
        - The server detects the presence of the CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto or X-Forwarded-Proto
        request headers with a values of https. These are typically set by some redirecting
        entity (like Cloudfront) that is in the business of rewriting the request URLs to remove
        the HTTPS protocol for internal request servicing.

    'ForceLinksToHttps' is a heavy handed way of accomplishing this in the absence of *-Forwarded-Proto
    headers. It is heavy handed because it will break thinks like accesses http://localhost that retrun
    redirects to content with URLs that reference the server (ex: the xml:base attribute in the DMR)

        'RequireUserSelection' - When enabled this will cause both the DAP2
        and DAP4 Data Request Forms to require the users to choose one or more
        variables before they may utilize the 'Get As X' buttons in the UI. This
        effectively prevents users from inadvertently asking that the entire
        dataset be converted into NetCDF (for example) when all they actually
        require are one or two variables. If not enabled the Data Request Forms
        will not require the user to make a selection.

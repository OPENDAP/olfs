## Project

###  Geo-Selection For Hyrax Data Request Form

#### Abstract
The Hyrax Data Request Form (aka IFH) provides a UI from which people can choose
and subset variables in a dataset. This project is to prototype adding a map
interface that displays the bounds of the variables in a dataset and that allows users generate
subset values for the geographic domain coordinates by using a mouse to select an
area on the map, or by entering latitude and longitude values in to text boxes
associated with the map UI.

#### Technical Details
Much of the data served by Hyrax contains geolocation information, however no
explicit use of these data are employed in the IFH. This has been a challenge
because there is little consistency in the naming of geographic domain coordinate
variables in the many datasets served by Hyrax.

The project is to develop at least one, but hopefuly several, protoype versions
of the IFH based on different datasets served by Hyrax. Each of these protoypes
will include the map UI and will connect the map UI to the underlying dataset by
employing a heuristic approach to determining which of the variables in the
dataset are the geographic domain coordinates.

Part of this heuristic should include searching the dataset and variable
metadata for the
Climate Forecast (CF) convention terms that would easily identify the geographic
domain coordinate variables within the dataset. If the dataset is either not
advertising (in the metadata) that it is using the CF convention, or if it claims
to utilize CF yet does not, the software should what obvious alternative names for
geographic domain coordinate variables such as:

- *latitude* == latitude | lat | y | Y
- *longitude* == longitude | lon | x | X

#### Helpful Experience

- Javscript
- Java
- XSLT (nice, but not a must)

#### First Steps

- Look at the Hyrax Data Request Form on (http://test.opendap.org/opendap/)
- Google OPeNDAP and look at the interface on deployed servers with real (not test) data

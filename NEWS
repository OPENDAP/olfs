Version 1.16.2 (10 Jan 2017)

- Improved logging, including log rotation.

- Fixed a null pointer exception in the AggregationServlet (the
  component that performs user-specified aggregations).

- Repaired viewers.xml configuration for Godiva3

- Issues with the netcdf file response History attribute were fixed,
  once again...

- Changed the XXX error message to YYY from 418 (I'm a teapot). But,
  we really liked the teapot...

Version 1.16.1  (02 Nov 2016)

- Updated OLFS configuration defaults in viewers.xml file to reflect
  changes for ncWMS2 and Godiva3
    
- Patched a problem with the way the XSL transforms are carried out
  that could have left the process running in an unexpected directory.
      

Version 1.16.0  (06 June 2016)

 - Added code to ammend the CF "history" attribute so that
    fileout_netcdf responses contain the ammended value that shows
    that Hyrax produced it along withg the constraint and id
    information of the dataset.

 - Added new rules for the Content-Disposition header download file
    names. Now the old behavior (add the netcdf file suffix to very
    file's basename) can be replaced so that if the suffix will end up
    as a duplicate (for example file.nc.nc or file.nc4.nc4), nothing
    is appended.

 - Added memory cache for BES Catalog responses. This allows the OLFS
    to stop asking the same things over and over again. The size and
    refresh interval are specified by the "<CatalogCache> element in
    the olfs.xml file. If the element is missing then the memory cache
    will be disabled.

 - Increased the number of simultaneous requests from 10 to 200 ,
    which is the default limit for Tomcat.

 -  Bug fixes
    - Large file issues in w10n.
    - Fixed build for WCS-2.0


Version 1.15.0  (08 February 2016)

 -  The OLFS regression test harness has been migrated from DejaGnu to AutoTest. This makes writing and maintaining
    tests much easier. All of the DejaGnu tests have been migrated and many additional tests added. To configure the
    tests:
        autoconf -vif
        ./configure
    To run the tests:
        make check

 -  Error handling has been refactored. Error messages from libdap and the BES are now correctly transmitted to the
    user. Additionally the HTTP status codes and associated pages are now working correctly and there should be a
    significant reduction in the number of "superman" (Internal Error) pages encountered in normal operation.

 -  The default size of the BES client pool has been increased from 10 to 200 in response to numerous performance
    evaluators that failed to recognize that this could be done to increase performance in high traffic environments.

 -  The OLFS now keeps the BES on a timeout leash so that BES requests that take longer than the time out interval
    stated in the olfs.xml will actually timeout and return an associated error to the OLFS.

 -  !!!!! The location of the OLFS configuration directory has changed !!!!
    This change should resolve installation problems with Tomcat instances that are installed from RPM.
    By default the OLFS will utilize it's bundled configuration in the directory
      $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/opendap/WEB-INF/conf
    In order to localize the configuration so that your configuration changes are persistent you will need to do
    one of the following:
      * For the user that will be running the OLFS (the Tomcat user), set the environment variable OLFS_CONFIG_DIR to
        an existing directory to which the Tomcat user has both read and write privileges.
      OR
      * Create the directory /etc/olfs and set it's permissions/ownership so that the Tomcat user has both read and
        write permission.
    (If both of these steps are done then priority is given to the environment variable.)
    Restart Tomcat. When it starts the OLFS will check these locations and then install a copy of its default
    configuration into the new spot.
    Edit the configuration files as needed.
    If, for example, your beslistener is not running on localhost:10022 then you'll need to edit the olfs.xml
    file in the configuration directory and adjust the <host> and <port>  values to reflect your situation.


Version 1.14.1 (28 October 2015)

  Worked under the hood to ensure that Hyrax's character encoding is actually UTF-8.

Version 1.14.0 (21 September 2015)

  Rollback from Java 8 requirement. Now only Java 7 is needed for the OLFS and Hyrax.
  Many bug fixes.
  Removal of unused parts of the API.


Version 1.13.2 (07 May 2015)

  New patched bugs in datasetScan implementation.


Version 1.13.1 (24 April 2015)

  New datasetScan implementation for THREDDS catalogs provides for all datasetScan activities as described here:
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/v4.6/tds/reference/DatasetScan.html
  As of the day of this writing.


Version 1.13.0 (07 April 2015)

  New w10n navigation and data access service.
  Updated ncWMS integration.
  Bug fix in THREDDS catalog inherited metadata injection.

Version 1.12.1 (05 January 2015)

  Disabled bug in our viewers page that was preventing some valid WMS datasets from receiving WMS and Godiva links.


Version 1.12.0 (03 December 2014)

 Refactored OLFS configuration file. Installing into
 an existing Hyrax instance will require installing
 the new opendap.war file; restarting tomcat;
 manually copying the file:
   $CATALINA_HOME/opendap/initialContent/olfs.xml
 to:
   $CATALINA_HOME/content/opendap/olfs.xml
 and restarting Tomcat again.
 Added security patches.

 characters into the MIME Type strings extracted
 from the clients Accept header, and thus causing '
 the server to incorrectly return a HTTP status of 406
